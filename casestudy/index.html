            <h2 class="title"> OVERVIEW</h2>
       <li>For this project, I created a recipe website using primarily PHP and MySQL. 
        From creating the design, to building the framework, then creating functionality, 
        this project has taught me many things about building relationships between 
        databases and websites.</li>


    <h2 class="title"> CONTEXT & CHALLENGE</h2>
        <li>Having no prior experience with PHP or working databases, it was a struggle 
        for me to get started on this project. This particular class was very challenging 
        to me due to the nature of the content. I was very apprehensive about getting started 
        because I wasn’t aware of the limitations of the language yet and wasn’t sure how to 
        move on with planning. </li>

    <h2 class="title"> PROCESS & INSIGHT</h2>
        <li>My first step for this project was laying out the design. I used Figma to create 
        the basic layout of my website. In doing this, I knew I wanted to create something 
        that was visually appealing and focused a lot on the images of the food itself. Next, 
        I made the framework for the site using HTML and CSS. Because of my prior experiences 
        with the languages, I felt comfortable at this point. I did give myself slight challenges 
        when it came to menu designs and ended up changing the initial design slightly, but I did 
        not have any major issues suring this stage.</li>

        <li>I was nervous to begin using PHP on my recipe site because it is something that I’ve 
        never worked with before. I know I am able to plan more efficiently when I am aware of my 
        limitations, but since this is something that is completely new to me, I found that I 
        overestimated some aspects of the project. I often find that my designs are limited because 
        of my coding ability, and this is something that occurred during this project as well. 
        After creating the initial framework of the project with HTML and CSS, I ended up changing 
        almost all of my pages for better organization. This was a very lengthy process for me, and 
        included fixing any links between pages. </li>

        <h3 class="title2"> Challenges</h3>
        <li>I had a lot of issues when it came to creating the functionality between the database 
        and forms. In my initial code for this page, I used input fields so that the user could 
        insert text, and later switched to text areas for better usability. Even with little changes 
        like this, some of my code managed to break. Doing this change caused my submit button to 
        stop working, despite it functioning minutes prior. It helped to reformat my code so that 
        everything was more readable. 
        </li>

        <li>A lot of my code was fixed by very small syntax issues. This surprised me because I spent 
        hours looking over what was wrong with the code only to find out that it was because of a 
        lowercase letter or a single space after my database name.  </li>

        <li>I also had trouble with creating the image upload function and this is something that I am 
        still currently struggling with. </li>

    <h2 class="title"> SOLUTION</h2>
    <li>Though I had my struggles, I found that research and asking for help were my best options when 
    trying to work through issues. In finding issues where google searches wouldn’t help, I found that 
    taking a step back in order to double check everything helps my process. It was extremely helpful 
    to have others look over my syntax because I was not able to catch everything myself. </li>


    <h2 class="title"> THE RESULTS</h2>
    <li>This project was semi-successful to me. While major functions within the recipe website are 
    working properly, there are a lot of things that I wish I could’ve done differently. Though this 
    is the case, I learned so much about using PHP and creating working databases because of it. 
    There are so many aspects of this project that caused me to struggle, but I tried my best and 
    was able to pull through.</li>
